4: Natural Language (NLP)


It’s time for us to learn how to analyse natural language documents, using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We’ll be focusing on the Hugging Face ecosystem, especially the Transformers library, and the vast collection of pretrained NLP models. Our project today will be to classify that similarity of phrases used to describe US patents. A similar approach can be applied to a wide variety of practical issues, in fields as wide-reaching as marketing, logistics, and medicine.
